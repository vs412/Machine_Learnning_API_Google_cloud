With Google Cloud, we can do things from running a typical virtual machine, to doing various machine learning tasks like analyzing text, speech, and imagery.

To begin, we're going to launch a virtual machine. The user interface to do this may change slightly in time but I expect the process to remain mostly the same.

The first thing you need to do is create an account. As of March 2017, if you create a new account, you should get $300 in free credit to explore the service.

Once you have an account, and you log in, click on the "console" link in the top right. This takes you to your, big surprise, console! If you just created a trial account, then you probably already have a project started/created for you.
